        <h4>Aims</h4>
        <p>
          EC3346 Family Economics is suitable for students with knowledge of
          microeconomics and basic econometric methods. Its aim is to
          familiarize students with a broad range of the methods and models
          applied by economists in the analysis of family issues. These issues
          include marriage and cohabitation, intra-household allocations,
          fertility, children development, and divorce. These phenomena will be
          modeled as the outcomes of rational-choice processes, with hypotheses
          concerning these choices evaluated in the context of relevant
          empirical evidence. Special attention will be focused on public
          policies influencing 'family' decisions. A broader goal is that
          students who take the course will, by working extensively with
          theoretical models, acquire analytical skills that are transferable to
          other kinds of intellectual problems.

        <h4>Week 1: Empirical stylized facts</h4>
        <p>
          By the end of this week you should be aware of the key stylized facts
          that the field of Family Economics seeks to explain.
        </p>

      <div class="p-abstract">
        <h4>Week 2: Economic gains</h4>
        <p>
          By the end of these weeks you should be familiar with the theories
          used by economics to explain partnership formation, including
          specialization, economies of scale, coordinated investments, and
          risk-sharing.

        <h4>Week 3: Decision making within the family</h4>
        <p>
          By the end of these weeks you should be aware of the main theories
          used by economics to model intra-household interactions, including
          unitary models, bargaining models, and “collective models”. You should
          also be aware of their predictions and their relative empirical
          support.

      <div class="p-abstract">
        <h4>Week 4-5: Matching and marriage outcomes</h4>
        <p>
          By the end of this week you should be aware of how economists model
          the selection into partnerships, using concepts such as stable
          matching and search frictions. You should also be aware of the
          empirical approaches to testing these theories.

      <div class="p-abstract">
        <h4>Week 7-8: Fertility</h4>
        <p>
          By the end of these weeks you should be familiar with the theories how
          fertility has been incorporated into economic theory, including the
          well-known quantity-quality model. We will then look at a set of
          empirical aspects of fertility, including the potential effectiveness
          of family planning policy, financial incentives, evidence on the
          quantity-quality model, and the effect of recessions.

        <h4>Week 9: Parenting and Investments</h4>
        <p>
          By the end of this week you should be familiar with how recent
          research has used the human capital / skills framework for modelling
          the effect of parenting and parental investments for children's
          development and skill formation.

          By the end of this week you be familiar with ways in which intimate
          partner violence can be theoretically modelled, and with some of the
          most well-known empirical economic studies of intimate partner
          violence.
